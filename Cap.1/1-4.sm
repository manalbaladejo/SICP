(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
	((if (> b 0) + -) a b)) 

#| Our model evaluation model, applicative-order, replace procedure name by his body and set his formal parameters by the arguments we provided.

If we eval (a-plus-abs-b 1 -1), a-plus-abs-b is substituted by his body, and formal parameters a and b, replaced by 1 and -1. If b is greater than 0, conditional expression returns + procedure, else, returns - procedure, and then applies to a b (1, -1) operands.
