;;; If you try to compute the Heron Square Roots calc method using a custom
;;; "If" procedure, you going to attach to aplicative-order model, this is,
;;; the general rules of evaluation of combinations, and the substitution model
;;; for procedure application. So you go to evaluate every subexpreesion on
;;; overll procedure, so you can fall in a recursive loop of evaluation in some
;;; procedures. In other hand, using a special form "If", allows to avoid this
;;; general procedure evaluation method.
