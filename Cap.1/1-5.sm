#| Following applicative-order model the evaluation falls on a recursive loop when try to eval p procedure, and replaces it by p procedure, and so, and so...
Is your substitution model is normal-order model, evaluation don't fall on recursive loop, because that p procedure never gonna be evaluated, because application flow never calls p procedure. |#
